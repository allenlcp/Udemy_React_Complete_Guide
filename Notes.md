JS Array Functions
Section 2, Lecture 23
Not really next-gen JavaScript, but also important: JavaScript array functions like map() , filter() , reduce()  etc.

You'll see me use them quite a bit since a lot of React concepts rely on working with arrays (in immutable ways).

The following page gives a good overview over the various methods you can use on the array prototype - feel free to click through them and refresh your knowledge as required: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array

Particularly important in this course are:

map()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
find()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find
findIndex()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex
filter()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
reduce()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce?v=b
concat()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat?v=b
slice()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice
splice()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice

## **REACT**

> Component is just a function returning some jsx
``` javascript
import React from 'react'; // When using jsx, we need to import react

const person = () => {
    return  <p>I'm a Person!</p>
};

export default person;
```
``` jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import Person from './Person';  // importing component

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>Hi, I'm a React App</h1>
        <Person/>   {/* using component*/}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default App;
```
